# RISC-V RV32IM ISA Implementation
### Overview
RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) that emphasizes simplicity, modularity, and extensibility. The RV32IM extension adds integer multiplication and division instructions to the base integer instruction set (RV32I).

Our project currently supports a few instructions, with ongoing development to expand the implementation.

### Supported Instructions
